# Open in Music

Opens Apple Music links in Music.app instead of the web app.

## Installation

I don't have a paid developer account because $100/yr is a not-insignificant fee and I'm not a Mac developer.

As a result the app is "unsigned" and installation steps are more complicated; You must sign the app yourself for *personal development "testing."*

### Requirements

- Xcode (free)
- Apple Developer account (free)

### Steps to install

1. [Download](https://github.com/mattdanielmurphy/open-in-music/archive/v0.1.zip) this repo.
